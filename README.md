# UnViewed

UnViewed (not named as unseen) is a project I developed with the support of my teacher to help visually impaired people. The project is designed for visually impaired people to find their way around sinks without any difficulty.

## Overview

This platform, which serves as an audio map to assist disabled people, works with four basic stages;

In the second stage, the sink owner is provided with an admin panel, where he can add, remove and edit his sinks. He can also create and edit an unique profile on the platform. I predict that the profile creation and editing phase will encourage sink owners to use the platform as it will strengthen brand awareness.

It has the following systems;
* Grabbing System (Create the sink map by dragging objects)
* Account System (Offer an account system)
* Translator System (offer multi-language support to increase the accessibility of the platform)
* Application (A single HTML file that can also work offline, this file is where the application converts the QR code into a map)

### Contribute

Your contributions to our project are very important for us! Although I am open to all contributions, I have to evaluate each pull request with my teacher since the project is not solely up to me.

### Sponsorship

It would be really nice if you sponsor my project on GitHub :) Sponsorship income will be used for materials such as SSL TLS certificates, DDoS protection, domain name rent. In addition to this project, sponsorship income will encouroge me for future projects, after all, I am a high school student for now.

If you won't contribute as sponsorship or pull request, you can also help by starring and/or forking the repository.

### Licence

The project uses GPL-3.0 license. (See [GPL-3.0 License](LICENSE))

## Understanding the working logic

### Beginning

It uses [Google Apps Script](https://script.google.com) to run the server. Apps Script connects to the [Google SpreadSheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets) table and processes the data through that table. So you need a Google account for Back-End to work. Front-End is written in standard Node.js and Express. I recommend [Vercel](https://vercel.com) to use.

### Required Technologies

The key technologies used by this project include:

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)
* [Express](https://expressjs.com)
* [Clasp](https://github.com/google/clasp)
* [Google Apps Script](https://script.google.com)
* [Google SpreadSheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets)

## Start development

These places are not available yet :) As you know, I have only worked on the project for two hours yet.
